# NeosVR-Biometrics


## Heart Monitoring
**Heart BPM** -- Your BPM is measured by counting the number of times your heart beats in one minute. This will be displayed in NeosVR as a number inside a small customizable heart you can place inside your name badge.

**Heart HRV** -- Your heart rate variability (HRV) is literally the variance in time between the beats of your heart. This will be displayed in NeosVR as a bar near your name badge that moves along a sliding scale.

**Audible Heartbeat** -- Your heartbeat can have an audible immersion option by inserting the heart object into the avatar within NeosVR.

**Heartbeat Haptic Feedback** -- Your heartbeat can have a haptic feedback immersion option by inserting the heart object into the avatar within NeosVR.
